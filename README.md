Fetch Coding Exercise - Software Engineering Internship
What do I need to submit?
Please write a program that reads from a CSV file called transactions.csv in the current working directory, processes an argument, and returns a response based on the conditions outlined in the next section.  You can use any language.  
We must be able to compile and run your code; provide any documentation necessary to accomplish this as part of the code you submit. Please assume the reviewer has not executed a code in your language before when developing your documentation. 
What does it need to do? 
Background 
Our users have points in their accounts. Users only see a single balance in their accounts. But for reporting purposes, we actually track their points per payer. In our system, each transaction record contains: payer (string), points (integer), timestamp (date). 
For earning points, it is easy to assign a payer. We know which actions earned the points. And thus, which partner should be paying for the points. 
When a user spends points, they don't know or care which payer the points come from. But, our accounting team does care how the points are spent. There are two rules for determining what points to "spend" first: 
We want the oldest points to be spent first (oldest based on transaction timestamp, not the order theyâ€™re received) 
We want no payer's points to go negative. 
We expect your code to
Read the transactions from a CSV file.
Spend points based on the argument using the rules above.
Return all payer point balances.
Example 

1. When you run your program, you will pass in an argument which is the amount of points to spend.
For example, using a Python program to spend 5000 points would look like this:

python3 mycode.py 5000
2. Your code will ingest a CSV file with an example sequence: 
"payer","points","timestamp"
"DANNON",1000,"2020-11-02T14:00:00Z"
"UNILEVER",200,"2020-10-31T11:00:00Z"
"DANNON",-200,"2020-10-31T15:00:00Z"
"MILLER COORS",10000,"2020-11-01T14:00:00Z"
"DANNON",300,"2020-10-31T10:00:00Z"


3. After the points are spent, the output should return the following results: 
{ 
"DANNON": 1000, 
"UNILEVER": 0, 
"MILLER COORS": 5300 
} 
In this repo, it included ```mycode.py``` and data file ```transactions.cvs```
# How to run the code
